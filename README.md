# Chat-GPT-assistant
The Miniature ChatGPT Voice Assistant is a project aimed at creating a compact and efficient voice-controlled assistant powered by GPT-3.5. It leverages advanced natural language processing and generation capabilities to enable seamless human-computer interactions.

Building a speech recognition system involves integrating hardware components, setting up cloud services, and writing code to capture, process, and interpret audio data. 

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide users with a miniature voice assistant that can understand spoken commands, generate contextual responses, and perform a variety of tasks

Scope
The scope of the Miniature ChatGPT Voice Assistant includes basic functionalities such as conversation, information retrieval and task execution through voice commands.

Features:
•	Voice input through ESP32-S3
•	Local speech recognition on ESP32-S3
•	Integration with a Speech-to-Text API for accurate transcription
•	ChatGPT API integration for generating responses
•	User-friendly chat interface with voice and text support

The main loop of the program would likely involve checking for touchpad input, starting a recording if the touchpad is pressed, sending the recording to the ChatGPT model, and displaying the model’s response on the TFT display.

System Architecture:
High-Level Architecture

The high-level architecture of the Miniature ChatGPT Voice Assistant involves the ESP32-S3 microcontroller handling local voice processing and the integration of cloud-based Speech-to-Text and ChatGPT APIs for advanced natural language understanding and response generation.

Components Overview
ESP32-S3 Module:
Handles local voice input and performs initial speech recognition.
Interacts with cloud-based APIs for extended natural language processing.

Speech Recognition Module:
Local module on ESP32-S3 for initial voice input processing.
Utilizes local models for basic voice command recognition.

Speech-to-Text API:
Cloud-based API for accurate transcription of voice input.
Enhances speech recognition results obtained locally on ESP32-S3.

ChatGPT API:
Cloud-based API for generating human-like responses.
Integrates with the ESP32-S3 to provide a rich conversational experience.

User Interface Module:
Manages the chat interface for users to interact through voice and text.

Interaction Flow
User provides a voice input by asking a question.
ESP32-S3 processes the voice input locally for basic command recognition.
Recognized speech is converted to text for accurate processing.
The user interface module displays the answer to the user's question on the device's screen.
